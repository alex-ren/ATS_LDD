-- How to create a file for loopback.
  >> dd if=/dev/zero of=/virtualfs bs=1024 count=307200


-- use loopon.sh / loopdown.sh to connect the loop device with the file


-- format the block device
  >> mkfs.msdos -F 32 /dev/loop0


-- use starttest.sh / stoptest.sh to do the test


-- Description of directories
  C/myfat was taken from linux source kernel_2.6.32-5-686_debian/fs/fat. 

  The Makefile has been modifed so that three modules are generated: 
  "myfat" (originally fat), "myvfat" (originally vfat) and "mymsdos" (originally msdos).

  Source files have to modifed to add trace. And the generated modules contains
  file system type "mymsdos" (originally msdos) "myvfat" (originally vfat).


  ATS/myfat_test
  This directory is built based on C/myfat. Basically I added more trace. I create this
  directory so that I can do some run-time test on the original fat module. I should freeze
  this directory except for add some more traces to certain files.


  ATS/myfat2
  The C files are written based on linux fat source code. I rerranged the files, removed
  certain functionality to make the files as simple as I can so that this directory can
  serve as a starting point for the ATS driver. The idea is to move part of the directory
  into ATS code gradually. Basically I should freeze the directory now.
